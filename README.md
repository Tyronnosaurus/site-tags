# site-tagger

## What it does

It is a Firefox extension where the user can tag any website. Whenever a link pointing to that website is found, it will be decorated with a relevant icon.

The tags are saved to local storage. Much of the functionality comes from Mozilla's example extension 'anotate-page'.
